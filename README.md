The first file which is 'Diabetes_Prediction_Final' is the google colab notebook that contains the data loading, preprocessing, and contains also the model training, evaluation, and finally testing by building a predictive system

The second file which is 'Diabetes_Prediction_Web_App' is the python script that I loaded in it both the model and the scaler as APIs, and it also contains the web app code lines
